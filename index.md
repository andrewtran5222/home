# Lab Report 1
Welcome to CSE 15L Lab Report 1. It seems like you crashed your old computer and need to set everything up again. Don't worry, I'm here to help.

## Step 1
First, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After greenlighting all the default settings and selling your soul to Microsoft, you should have see this screen (If you are a demon that is not using dark mode, your color scheme may be a bit different.):

## Step 2
Next, click "Terminal" at the top of the program and then "Open New Terminal". `Ctrl + Shift + ' `might also work for you, but it didn't for me for some reason.

## Step 3
To log into the remote server, use the command `$ssh cs15lwi23aor@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
"cs15lwi23aor" is should be your course username. Replace "aor" with whatever your actual username is, and "cs15lwi23" probably stands for Computer Science 13 Lab Winter 2023, but hey, your guess is as good as mine's.

## Step 4
Finally, after entering your password and logging in (your password won't appear on screen as you type for security purposes), you should have access to the server. Here are the commands we were taught so far:

* `pwd`: Print working directory - Print the name of the current directory
* `cd`: Change directory - Follow with name of the directory to move into it, or .. to move backwards, ~ to return to the home directory. 
* `ls`: List - List all the files in the current directory.
* `cat`: I'm not sure, and I probably should study up on this one more.
